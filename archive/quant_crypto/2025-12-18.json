        "title": "Asymptotic and finite-sample distributions of one- and two-sample empirical relative entropy, with application to change-point detection",
        "summary": "Relative entropy, as a divergence metric between two distributions, can be used for offline change-point detection and extends classical methods that mainly rely on moment-based discrepancies. To build a statistical test suitable for this context, we study the distribution of empirical relative entropy and derive several types of approximations: concentration inequalities for finite samples, asymptotic distributions, and Berry-Esseen bounds in a pre-asymptotic regime. For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions. Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies. We then detail a change-point detection procedure built on relative entropy and compare it, through extensive simulations, with classical methods based on moments or on information criteria. Finally, we illustrate its practical relevance on two real datasets involving temperature series and volatility of stock indices.",

        "reason_zh": "这篇论文提出了基于相对熵的变点检测方法，这对于加密货币市场量化因子构造和策略设计具有高度相关性。加密货币市场常表现出非正态、重尾分布等特征，传统的基于矩的变点检测方法可能不够鲁棒，而相对熵作为一种更广义的分布差异度量，能更好地捕捉市场结构性变化或范式转换。论文在理论上非常严谨，深入探讨了经验相对熵的渐近和有限样本分布，并给出了Berry-Esseen界，这对于统计学硕士背景的你来说，理解其统计基础非常有益。其在股票指数波动率上的应用也直接证明了其在金融领域的实用性。你可以利用这种方法来构建反映市场状态变化的因子，或者设计基于市场结构变化的动态策略。"
