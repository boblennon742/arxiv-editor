        "title": "Reinforcement Learning in Financial Decision Making: A Systematic Review of Performance, Challenges, and Implementation Strategies",
        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an innovative approach to financial decision making, offering specialized solutions to complex investment problems where traditional methods fail. This review analyzes 167 articles from 2017--2025, focusing on market making, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. It identifies key performance issues and challenges in RL for finance. Generally, RL offers advantages over traditional methods, particularly in market making. This study proposes a unified framework to address common concerns such as explainability, robustness, and deployment feasibility. Empirical evidence with synthetic data suggests that implementation quality and domain knowledge often outweigh algorithmic complexity. The study highlights the need for interpretable RL architectures for regulatory compliance, enhanced robustness in nonstationary environments, and standardized benchmarking protocols. Organizations should focus less on algorithm sophistication and more on market microstructure, regulatory constraints, and risk management in decision-making.",

        "reason_zh": "这篇论文虽然不是直接关于因子构造，但它是一篇关于强化学习在金融决策中应用的系统性综述。对于加密货币市场的策略设计和回测（特别是涉及到复杂动态和非线性关系时），强化学习是一个非常重要的工具。论文强调了在非平稳环境中的鲁棒性、可解释性和部署可行性等挑战，这些在波动剧烈的加密货币市场中尤为关键。它提供了一个统一的框架，并指出“实施质量和领域知识往往比算法复杂性更重要”，这对于实际落地和策略设计具有很强的指导意义。作为一篇综述，它能帮助硕士生快速了解RL在金融领域的应用现状、挑战和未来方向，从而为后续的策略设计提供思路和工具选择。"
