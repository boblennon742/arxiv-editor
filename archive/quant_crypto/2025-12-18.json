        "title": "Asymptotic and finite-sample distributions of one- and two-sample empirical relative entropy, with application to change-point detection",
        "summary": "Relative entropy, as a divergence metric between two distributions, can be used for offline change-point detection and extends classical methods that mainly rely on moment-based discrepancies. To build a statistical test suitable for this context, we study the distribution of empirical relative entropy and derive several types of approximations: concentration inequalities for finite samples, asymptotic distributions, and Berry-Esseen bounds in a pre-asymptotic regime. For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions. Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies. We then detail a change-point detection procedure built on relative entropy and compare it, through extensive simulations, with classical methods based on moments or on information criteria. Finally, we illustrate its practical relevance on two real datasets involving temperature series and volatility of stock indices.",

        "reason_zh": "这篇论文专注于利用相对熵进行变点检测，并提供了严谨的渐近和有限样本分布理论。对于加密货币市场这种高度动态和非平稳的环境，识别市场结构、波动率或因子有效性发生变化的变点至关重要。虽然它不直接构造一个量化因子，但变点检测可以作为构建自适应因子模型或动态交易策略的基础工具，例如，在不同市场机制下调整因子权重或切换策略。其理论严谨性（如Berry-Esseen界限）非常适合统计学硕士的背景，且在股票指数波动率上的应用也表明了其在金融领域的潜在实践价值。"
